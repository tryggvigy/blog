This is a directory of `.mdx` files that represent the blog posts.

IMPORTANT:

- NEVER use en dashes, or em dashes
- NEVER use emojis in the blog post headings
- Write in a conversational, personal tone - avoid corporate/marketing language
- Use specific examples and personal experiences when possible
- Avoid overly structured lists unless they serve a clear purpose
- Don't use phrases like "In this post, I'll explore..." or "Let's dive into..."
- Keep sentences varied in length - mix short and long
- Use contractions naturally (don't, can't, won't)
- Avoid buzzwords and jargon unless necessary for the topic
- Write conclusions that feel natural, not summarized
- Use "I" and personal voice rather than third person
- Don't end posts with call-to-action phrases
- I am a senior engineer working at a big tech company with over 10 years of experience. I want to avoid AI slop, and low quality or entry-level tutorial content.
