# About

Welcome to my tech blog! This is where I share insights, tutorials,
and thoughts about web development, programming, and technology.

I currently work as a software engineer at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
in the Desktop client and Web Player team.

I'm passionate about building modern web applications and exploring new
technologies. Through this blog, I aim to document my learning journey and
share knowledge with the developer community.

Feel free to explore the posts and reach out if you have any
questions or suggestions.
